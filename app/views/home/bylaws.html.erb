A Director has an indirect interest in a transaction if another entity in which the Director has a material interest or in which the Director is a general partner is a party to the transaction, or if another entity of which the Director is a Director, officer or trustee is a party to the transaction and the transaction is or should be considered by the Board of Directors of the Institute.
(b)    Approval.

A conflict of interest transaction is not voidable or the basis for imposing liability on the Director if the transaction is fair to the Institute at the time it was entered into or is approved either (i) in advance by the vote of the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors if the material facts of the transaction and the Director’s interest were disclosed or known to the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors, or (ii) if the material facts of the transactions and the Director’s interest were disclosed or known to the members and they authorized, approved or ratified the transaction.

By the Directors, if it receives the affirmative vote of a majority of the Directors on the Board of Directors or a committee of the Board of Directors who have no direct or indirect interest in the transaction; provided that a transaction may not be so authorized, approved or ratified by a single Director.

The presence of, or a vote cast by, a Director with a direct or indirect interest in the transaction does not affect the validity of any action so taken hereunder if the transaction is otherwise approved as permitted under Section 65.361 of the Act.

(2)          By Members.  By the members, if it receives a majority of the votes entitled to be counted.  Votes cast by or voted under the control of a Director who has a direct or indirect interest in the transaction, and votes cast by or voted under the control of an entity described in subsection (4) of Section 65.361 of the Act may be counted in a vote of members to determine whether to authorize, approve or ratify a conflict of interest transaction hereunder.
